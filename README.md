## How could I have improved
- I could have compared the loaded data with the save data and then update save data if returns true using: `JSON.stringify(storedData) === JSON.stringify(k2); // true`
- I could have used ReactJS

### Disclaimer:
- This is a test project I built to showcase my knowledge.
- I built the app myself based on a design I was given.
- This is not my designs or idea.
